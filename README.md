Project 3 for Rutgers Data Science BootCamp

    The purpose of this project was to create a relationship between multiple Dataframes that can be queried to help understand what factors effect movie ratings.  We extracted movie data as it regards to ratings and transformed it into readable Dataframes in Pandas and Polars, from there we loaded the data into SQL and created keys and constraints so that all the data can be easily accessed using SQL queries.
    To interact with the data you would use SQL queries.  By doing this and selecting different categories in the cleaned data sets, you can see how that relates to a movies rating. 
    We sourced all of our data through Kaggle, a public forum for data sets. So we did not risk crossing ethical boundaries.  The data also is in regard to Movies rather than personal data of any kind. Further removing us from any potential ethical issues.

    Slight troubleshooting tips came from ChatGPT, vast majority of this code is our own.
